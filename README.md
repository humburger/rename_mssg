There was time when after vacation were many task related messages. It was overwhelming to read one by one and to to do, so there was idea that I could collect those messages into one folder and just rename them for faster work mobility. Script renames messages according to what information is into them relating to tasks.
There is similar second script which renames user related messages with their usernames from within for faster catch-up which  user needs which password/restart or smth.
